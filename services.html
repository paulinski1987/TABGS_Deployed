        <p>Want to update the look of your bathroom? There are few additions you can make that transform your bathroom
          as drastically as the addition of a glass shower. Whether building a new house or renovating your existing
          washroom, installing a new glass shower will give your facilities a sleek and clean modern look. Did I mention
          glass is easier to keep clean than ceramic?</p>

        <p>Building a new house, renovating your existing house, or repairing damage from a baseball from the
          neighborhood children, we can do it all. We can install prefabricated units complete with rfaming and
          finishing or we can build the window by hand using modern aluminum framing or classic wood. If you like your
          existing framing we can replicate it so it matches the rest of your windows</p>

        <p>A leaking window frame can cause significant damage to your home. Water that has leaked in can damage your
          walls, degrade the framing or even cause mold to grow inside the walls. Removing old material and applying new
          caulking at the first sign of a leak will save you time, money and stress.</p>

        <p>Glass doors have become popular in office buildings, store fronts, and houses. We can install traditional
          swinging doors as well as sliding doors depending on the setting. All door panes are made with tempered or
          laminated glass which are safe and secure.</p>

        <p>Glass railings can be installed anywhere a traditional wood railing could. They can be used on interior or
          exterior staircases, porches, patios, balconies and terraces. While they are very stylish glass railings are
          extremely safe, often sturdier than their wood counterparts. All railings use strong safety glass that can
          withstand significant force.</p>
